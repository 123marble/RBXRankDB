# RBXRankDB
A wrapper to connect [RankDB server](https://github.com/Vivino/rankdb/tree/master) to your ROBLOX games ðŸŒŸ!


## Why use RBXRankDB?

A limitation of ROBLOX's Ordered Datastore is that it [does not support the retrieval of specific ranks](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/how-to-get-players-rank-in-ordered-datastore-leaderboard/1080297/12?u=123marble). In order to run such queries on large leaderboards in your ROBLOX games, an externally hosted solution such as RankDB is needed.
